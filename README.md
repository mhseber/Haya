# Next.js Data Fetching Guide

This project demonstrates different ways of **data fetching** in Next.js.  
Next.js supports both **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**, **Static Site Generation (SSG)**, and **Client-Side Fetching**.

---

## ðŸ”¹ 1. Server-Side Rendering (SSR)

- Runs **on every request**
- Fetches fresh data from the server
- Implemented using `getServerSideProps` or in App Router with **async Server Components**

ðŸ”¹ 2. Static Site Generation (SSG)

Runs at build time

Data is pre-rendered and served as static HTML

Best for content that doesnâ€™t change often

ðŸ”¹ 3. Client-Side Fetching

Runs in the browser after the page loads

Useful for user interaction, dashboards, or frequently updated data

Usually done with useEffect and fetch or libraries like SWR/React Query

âœ… When to Use What?

SSR â†’ data changes frequently, needs to be fresh (e.g., user profile, dashboard).

SSG â†’ data is mostly static (e.g., blog, docs, product pages).

Client-Side Fetching â†’ user-specific, interactive, or real-time updates.
